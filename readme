=======
This version depend on ds2sdk 0.12beta, also it is an application of ds2sdk.
To compile the source, Linux operation system are recomended to build the cross-comiling evironment.
You could see the specified steps in readme.txt of ds2sdk released if you don't know how to do.
Now Release ndssfc_Vx.x.zip to the work directory you want, then you have to do two things:

1. specify gcc position
export PATH=$PATH:/opt/mipsel-4.1.2-nopic/bin
Of course, you can specify anywhere if you like.
If you have no gcc compiled tools, you can find them in released ds2sdk.

2. specify ds2sdk position
export DS2SDKPATH=/opt/ndssfc
The path is the ds2sdk root directory.
If you don't specify ds2sdk position, the console will give you a notice:

"Please set DS2SDKPATH in your environment: export DS2SDKPATH=<path to>ds2sdk"

Also, you can specify anywhere if you like.

After the two things are ready, you only need to do:

make clean
make
